This is a data challenge at Baker Hughes (BH)! As we dive into our gas turbine engine data, we're embarking on a journey to 
uncover valuable insights that will drive us towards a sustainable energy future. 
With Power BI as our tool of choice, we'll leverage its capabilities to analyze, visualize, and communicate our findings effectively.
Let's harness the power of data to make informed decisions and propel our mission forward. Together, we can shape a cleaner, greener, 
and more efficient world. Let the challenge begin! 

The excel files feeding this analysis were made from 213 data files preprocessed in Python and we created some metric columns using DAX functions.
